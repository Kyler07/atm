I wrote this in college, and I recommend this program to anyone who wants to learn C++, or any introduction to object oriented programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n**PURPOSE:    **    \r\nWrite a program that simulates as an atm machine\r\n\r\n**TASKS:   **             \r\n* 1. Create an account that has the ability to \r\n* 2. Check checking account balance\r\n* 3. Check savings account balance\r\n* 4. Make transfers between each account\r\n* 5. Make deposits into accounts\r\n* 6. Make withdrawals from accounts\r\n\r\n\r\n**INSTRUCTIONS:   **     \r\n* Enter pin number '1234'\r\n* Checkings Account Balance = 100\r\n* Savings Account Balance = 600\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n    int getTransfer() {\r\n       int AmountTransfer;\r\n       int TransferTo = this->type== 1 ? 2 : 1;\r\n\r\n       cout << \"Enter amount to transfer to your \"<< AccountType[TransferTo] << \" account.\"<< endl;\r\n       cin >>  AmountTransfer;\r\n\r\n       if(AmountTransfer <= AccountDetails[this->type]) {\r\n          // update the current account balance in the selected account\r\n          int NewBalance = this->balance -= AmountTransfer;\r\n          AccountDetails[this->type] = NewBalance;\r\n\r\n          // Set the new transfered amount to transfered account\r\n          int TransferedAmount = AccountDetails[TransferTo] += AmountTransfer;\r\n          AccountDetails[TransferTo] = TransferedAmount;\r\n\r\n          cout << \"$\" << AmountTransfer << \" has been transfered to your \"<< AccountType[TransferTo] << \" account.\" << endl;\r\n           getBalance();\r\n\r\n       } else {\r\n           cout << \"Insuffient funds.\" << endl;\r\n           getBalance();\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       return 0;\r\n    }","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
